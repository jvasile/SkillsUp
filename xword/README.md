# XWord

Do you like crossword puzzles?  We do!  Let's make some.

## Exercise 1

Make a crossword puzzle using words from your favorite book.  Pick 15
or so important words from it.  Nouns work really well: the names of
characters, places and significant objects are easy to describe and
fit into a puzzle.  Using paper and pencil, fit as many of those words
into a crossword grid as you can.
  
Now your paper puzzle into a crossword using HTML and CSS.  You'll
need a column for the clues and a column to hold the grid.  Make the
grid out of a table and style the cells using CSS.

Skills: HTML Tables, Columns (either CSS or HTML), CSS styling of borders and text

## Exercise 2

Styling all those table cells can be a pain.  Shouldn't the computer
do it for you?  Add javascript to your crossword so it types all those
cell for you.

Given a string like this:

    ...CROSSWORD...
    ...S..K........
    ...S..I........
    ......L........
    ...HTML........
    ......S........
    ......U........
    ..SCRIPT.......
    
Automatically generate your empty grid table and write it in the body
of your HTML page.  It should automatically number cells where words
start.  Now print out your puzzle and see if your friends can solve
it!

Skills: Javascript strings, loops, conditionals, document.write


## Exercise 3

Now that you can make crossword puzzles so easily, extend Exercise 2
so that your puzzle's cells are form fields.  Let your user enter
their solution without printing the puzzle out.

Skills: HTML forms

## Exercise 4

Filling in the crossword is fun, but what if you want to peek at the
solution?  Extend the work you did in Exercise 3 to display the solved
version of the crossword instead.  Make a button to switch back and
forth between the solved and unsolved versions of the puzzle.  Make a
button to check that the entered solution is correct.

Skills: Javascript strings, loops, conditionals, document.write,
onclick buttons
