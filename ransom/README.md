# Ransom Note

## Exercise 1

You are a villain, and you've stolen somebody's favorite toy!  Write
them a note telling them what they have to do to get it back.  Keep it
short-- just a couple sentences should do it.

Skills: typing, basic text-editor

## Exercise 2

Make a basic HTML page, and put your ransom note in the body of the
page.  Use CSS (either inline, in the head, or in a separate
stylesheet) to decorate each letter's color, size, and font-face so
the page looks like a ransom note.  If you want to know what a ransom
