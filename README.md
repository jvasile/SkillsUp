# SkillsUp

Get your skills up!

This repository collects coding exercises for kids and beginners.  Our
goal is to teach Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Python.

Each exercise is in its own directory and can contain the problem, as
well as some solutions and explanations.

I would love to fill this repo with all kinds of fun challenges.
Please fork and send me pull requests for additional exercises,
refinements, corrections, correct solutions, worksheets, or anything
else you can think of!

Our exercises so far:

 * Ransom note - Use css styles to change how letters look and make a ransom note.
 
 * Hangman - make a simple hangman game in the browser or at the command line
 
 * Tic Tac Toe - make a tic-tac-toe board and let users fill it with
   X's and O's.  Teach the computer how to play for extra credit!

 * Connect four - make a Connect-Four board and let users fill it with chips
